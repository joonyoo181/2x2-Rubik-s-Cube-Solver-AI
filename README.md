# 2x2-Rubiks-Cube-Solver-AI

## Summary
As part of a research program at California Institute of Technology, my team and I developed an Autonomous program that could solve 2x2 Rubik's Cube at any given state.
We researched and tested deep approximate value iteration, weighted A* search, Autodidactic Iteration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search => Ended up using Autodidactic Iteration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search with neural networks.

### Result
<p> ```model_old``` was trained for ~60 mins => ~26% accuracy </p>
<p> ```model_620min``` was trained for ~620 mins => 83.8% accuracy </p>

## Running the Program

### 1) Input the Cube State

### 2) Execute the Program
